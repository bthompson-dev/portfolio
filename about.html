        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>
          For the past year, I’ve been studying at UCL for an MSc in Computer
          Science. The course has covered a lot – everything from low-level
          computer architecture, all the way to software engineering and machine
          learning. It’s both challenged and inspired me, giving me a greater
          sense of everything I don’t know, but also the drive to continue
          learning and solve even harder problems.
        </p>

        <p>
          I first started coding with the simple purpose of building a website
          for my business. After several weeks of looking up obscure CSS
          properties and JavaScript methods, I had a working website, and
          realised I was enjoying myself! From there, I just kept going, trying
          out new frameworks and technologies to see what I could create.
        </p>

        <p>
          That’s one of the things I like about computer science – there’s
          always more to learn. Over the last year I’ve programmed in Python,
          TypeScript and C# – but one thing the degree has taught me is that
          these are just tools. Having spent the time to gain a deeper
          understanding of the fundamentals, I feel like I can pick up and use
          anything I might need.
        </p>

        <p>
          For my current project, I’m building a local AI application to use
          LibreOffice via an MCP server, targeted at using the NPUs on some of
          the newest Intel laptops. I’m very excited about the potential for AI
          to transform the tech industry, and it’s a thrill to be testing out
          cutting-edge AI models and solutions.
        </p>

        <p>
          You can check out my progress here:

          </span>
        </p>

        <p>
          When not coding, I can be found listening to new music, playing
          tennis, competing in online chess or walking my dog Rosa.
