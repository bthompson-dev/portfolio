        <h1>About me</h1>

        <p>
          I’ve always been interested in the web and how it works. So when I
          first needed a personal website, I decided to try and put it together
          myself. How hard could it be…?
        </p>
        <p>
          A few months later, after some YouTube tutorials and heavy googling… I
          had a working website online.
        </p>
        <p>
          The satisfaction of finally figuring it out started me on a journey to
          learn more and push myself further to see what I could create.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’ve always enjoyed challenging myself. That’s one of the things I
          like about web development – there’s always more to learn. New
          technologies and approaches, different ways of doing things you
          haven’t considered.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’ve worked in a diverse range of roles, from private tutor to
          professional actor, but the main thing that’s motivated me is finding
          that challenge in whatever I’m doing.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a full-stack developer, I’m interested in creating user-friendly,
          innovative web applications that solve real problems. I enjoy using
          React, JavaScript, and NodeJS – but am always interested to try out
          new languages and tech.
        </p>
        <p>
          When not coding my latest side-project, I can be found listening to
          new music, playing tennis, competing in online chess or walking my dog
          Rosa.
